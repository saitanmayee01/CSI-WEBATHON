			<h3>About me..</h3>
			<p>
				I was bought up in bangalore and all my education was done here, but my native is Andhra pradhesh.
				I have always loved this city.The schools and education here, have a different approach towards
				students, helping them develop young minds in different directions which is amazing! My main aim was to pursue 
				a B.E. in computer science to provide innovative ideas and bring a change, which the wolrd is craving for 
				right now.

                <p>
                    Since my childhood, I used to love involving in extracurricular activities. I used to always stand up
                    for any sort of fests or activities going on in the school. I have participated in many <strong>chess tournaments</strong>
                    and I hav reached <strong> Karnataka state level</strong> twice. I have also played quite a few badminton 
                    tournaments. I also had developed a great interest and also used to participate in various <strong>dance</strong>,<strong>music</strong> and
                    <strong>arts</strong> programs.

                <h3> Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                Well..I have quite a few interesting hobbies. I recently learned to <strong>play guitar</strong> from youtube tutorials.
                I've always been enthusiastic about <strong>different forms of painting and sketching</strong>. All thanks to my school for building
                interest about fine arts in me.I'm also a great fan of thriller novels and movies, and I've read many thriller 
                novels during my school, and maybe I am sort of a good reader, but not voracious though!
